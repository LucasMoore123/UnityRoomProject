My scene is the inside of an office. It has a bunch of silly assets that were found in the unity asset website.
I included a chair, a desk, a laptop, a bowl with some fruits, and some other decorations.
I did not have any specific inspiration. I just wanted to create a funny scene with some cute assets from the unity website.
The main character is a low poly RPG character, who is looking at this room. He is very confused about what's going on.

All Assets Came From The Free Section Of The Unity Asset Website.
